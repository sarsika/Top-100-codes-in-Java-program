Problem Statement 
You are given N pastries, where each pastry has a certain number of cherries.
You need to pack these pastries into boxes such that a box is called perfect if the sum of cherries in that box is divisible by 3.

Rules:

Each pastry can be used only once.
A box can contain any number of pastries.
Pastries can be arranged in any order.
Your task is to find the maximum number of perfect boxes that can be formed.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N — the number of pastries.
The second line contains N integers, where each integer represents the number of cherries on a pastry.

Output Format:
Print a single integer — the maximum number of perfect boxes.

Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
0 ≤ cherries ≤ 10⁹

Sample Input:
7
3 1 6 4 7 5 2

Sample Output:
4

Explanation:

The pastries can be grouped into boxes such that the sum of cherries in each box is divisible by 3.
The maximum number of such perfect boxes that can be formed is 4.

         int N = sc.nextInt();
         int count0 = 0;
         int count1 = 0;
         int count2 = 0;
         for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
         int x = sc.nextInt() % 3;
         if (x == 1)
            count0++;
         else if(x == 2) 
            count1++;
        else
            count2++;
         }
         int boxes = 0;
         boxes += count0;
         int pair = Math.min(count1, count2);
         int boxes += pair;
         count1 -= pair;
         count2 -= pair;
         boxes += count1 / 3;
         boxes += count2 / 3;
         System.out.println(boxes);
         sc.close();
      }
}
