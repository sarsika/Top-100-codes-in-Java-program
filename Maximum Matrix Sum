// Maximum Matrix Sum 
You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:
Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.
Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
Output: 4

Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]
Output: 16

Explanation: We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:
- Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.

Constraints:
n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
2 <= n <= 250
-105 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105

              for(int[] row : matrix) {
                  for(int val : row) {
                      if(val < 0) {
                         negCount++;
                      }
                      int abs = mth.abs(val);
                      sum += abs;
                      min = Math.min(min, abs);
                  }
               }
              if(negCount % 2 == 0) 
                 return sum;
              return sum - 2L * min;
         }
