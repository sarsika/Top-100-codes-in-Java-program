Given an integer input the objective is to write a Java code to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd. To do so the main idea is to divide the number by 2 and check if it’s divisible or not. It’s an Even number is it’s perfectly divisible by 2 or an Odd number otherwise.
code<>
public class Main
 {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
           int number = 29;


     //checking whether the number is even or odd
     if (number % 2 == 0)
              System.out.println(number + " is Even");
     else
              System.out.println(number + " is odd");
      }
 }

Output
29 is Odd
