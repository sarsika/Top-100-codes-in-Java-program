// Number of Ways to Paint N * 3 Gird
You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: 
Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).
Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 12

Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214

Constraints:
n == grid.length
1 <= n <= 5000

// Java Code

class Solution {
    public int numOfWays(int n) {
        long MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        long TypeA = 6;
        long TypeB = 6;
        for(int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            long newA = (2 * TypeA + 2 * TypeB) % MOD;
            long newB = (2 * TypeA + 3 * TypeB) % MOD;
            TypeA = newA;
            TypeB = newB;
        }
        return(int)((TypeA + TypeB) % MOD);
    }
}
